              In 2010, Thomas Thwaites decided he wanted to build a toaster from
              scratch. He walked into a shop, purchased the cheapest toaster he
              could find, and promptly went home and broke it down piece by
              piece.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thwaites had assumed the toaster would be a relatively simple
              machine. By the time he was finished deconstructing it, however,
              there were more than 400 components laid out on his floor. The
              toaster contained over 100 different materials with three of the
              primary ones being plastic, nickel, and steel.
            </p>

            <p>
              He decided to create the steel components first. After discovering
              that iron ore was required to make steel, Thwaites called up an
              iron mine in his region and asked if they would let him use some
              for the project.
            </p>

            <p>Surprisingly, they agreed.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Toaster Project</h2>

            <p>The victory was short-lived.</p>

            <p>
              When it came time to create the plastic case for his toaster,
              Thwaites realized he would need crude oil to make the plastic.
              This time, he called up BP and asked if they would fly him out to
              an oil rig and lend him some oil for the project. They immediately
              refused. It seems oil companies aren’t nearly as generous as iron
              mines.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thwaites had to settle for collecting plastic scraps and melting
              them into the shape of his toaster case. This is not as easy as it
              sounds. The homemade toaster ended up looking more like a melted
              cake than a kitchen appliance.
            </p>

            <p>
              This pattern continued for the entire span of The Toaster Project.
              It was nearly impossible to move forward without the help of some
              previous process. To create the nickel components, for example, he
              had to resort to melting old coins. He would later say, “I
              realized that if you started absolutely from scratch you could
              easily spend your life making a toaster.”

            <h2>Don’t Start From Scratch</h2>

            <p>Starting from scratch is usually a bad idea.</p>

            <p>
              Too often, we assume innovative ideas and meaningful changes
              require a blank slate. When business projects fail, we say things
              like, “Let’s go back to the drawing board.” When we consider the
              habits we would like to change, we think, “I just need a fresh
              start.” However, creative progress is rarely the result of
              throwing out all previous ideas and innovations and completely
              re-imagining of the world.
            </p>

            <p>Consider an example from nature:</p>

            <p>
              Some experts believe the feathers of birds evolved from reptilian
              scales. Through the forces of evolution, scales gradually became
              small feathers, which were used for warmth and insulation at
              first. Eventually, these small fluffs developed into larger
              feathers capable of flight.
            </p>

            <p>
              There wasn’t a magical moment when the animal kingdom said, “Let’s
              start from scratch and create an animal that can fly.” The
              development of flying birds was a gradual process of iterating and
              expanding upon ideas that already worked.
            </p>

            <p>
              The process of human flight followed a similar path. We typically
              credit Orville and Wilbur Wright as the inventors of modern
              flight. However, we seldom discuss the aviation pioneers who
              preceded them like Otto Lilienthal, Samuel Langley, and Octave
              Chanute. The Wright brothers learned from and built upon the work
              of these people during their quest to create the world’s first
              flying machine.
            </p>

            <p>
              The most creative innovations are often new combinations of old
              ideas. Innovative thinkers don’t create, they connect.
              Furthermore, the most effective way to make progress is usually by
              making 1 percent improvements to what already works rather than
              breaking down the whole system and starting over.
            </p>

            <h2>Iterate, Don’t Originate</h2>

            <p>
              The Toaster Project is an example of how we often fail to notice
              the complexity of our modern world. When you buy a toaster, you
              don’t think about everything that has to happen before it appears
              in the store. You aren’t aware of the iron being carved out of the
              mountain or the oil being drawn up from the earth.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are mostly blind to the remarkable interconnectedness of
              things. This is important to understand because in a complex world
              it is hard to see which forces are working for you as well as
              which forces are working against you. Similar to buying a toaster,
              we tend to focus on the final product and fail to recognize the
              many processes leading up to it.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you are dealing with a complex problem, it is usually better
              to build upon what already works. Any idea that is currently
              working has passed a lot of tests. Old ideas are a secret weapon
              because they have already managed to survive in a complex world.
