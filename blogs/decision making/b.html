            The economist J.K. Galbraith once wrote, “Faced with a choice
            between changing one’s mind and proving there is no need to do so,
            almost everyone gets busy with the proof.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Leo Tolstoy was even bolder: “The most difficult subjects can be
            explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea
            of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the
            most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows
            already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.”
          </p>

          <p>
            What’s going on here? Why don’t facts change our minds? And why
            would someone continue to believe a false or inaccurate idea anyway?
            How do such behaviors serve us?
          </p>

          <h2>The Logic of False Beliefs</h2>
          <p>
            Humans need a reasonably accurate view of the world in order to
            survive. If your model of reality is wildly different from the
            actual world, then you struggle to take effective actions each day.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, truth and accuracy are not the only things that matter to
            the human mind. Humans also seem to have a deep desire to belong.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Atomic Habits, I wrote, “Humans are herd animals. We want to fit
            in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and approval of our
            peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival. For most of
            our evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming
            separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a death
            sentence.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Understanding the truth of a situation is important, but so is
            remaining part of a tribe. While these two desires often work well
            together, they occasionally come into conflict.
          </p>

          <p>
            In many circumstances, social connection is actually more helpful to
            your daily life than understanding the truth of a particular fact or
            idea. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker put it this way,
            “People are embraced or condemned according to their beliefs, so one
            function of the mind may be to hold beliefs that bring the
            belief-holder the greatest number of allies, protectors, or
            disciples, rather than beliefs that are most likely to be true.”
          </p>

          <p>
            We don’t always believe things because they are correct. Sometimes
            we believe things because they make us look good to the people we
            care about.
          </p>

          <p>
            I thought Kevin Simler put it well when he wrote, “If a brain
            anticipates that it will be rewarded for adopting a particular
            belief, it’s perfectly happy to do so, and doesn’t much care where
            the reward comes from — whether it’s pragmatic (better outcomes
            resulting from better decisions), social (better treatment from
            one’s peers), or some mix of the two.”
          </p>

          <p>
            False beliefs can be useful in a social sense even if they are not
            useful in a factual sense. For lack of a better phrase, we might
            call this approach “factually false, but socially accurate.” When we
            have to choose between the two, people often select friends and
            family over facts.
          </p>

          <p>
            This insight not only explains why we might hold our tongue at a
            dinner party or look the other way when our parents say something
            offensive, but also reveals a better way to change the minds of
            others.

          <h2>Facts Don’t Change Our Minds. Friendship Does.</h2>
          <p>
            Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of
            convincing them to change their tribe. If they abandon their
            beliefs, they run the risk of losing social ties. You can’t expect
            someone to change their mind if you take away their community too.
            You have to give them somewhere to go. Nobody wants their worldview
            torn apart if loneliness is the outcome.
          </p>

          <p>
            The way to change people’s minds is to become friends with them, to
            integrate them into your tribe, to bring them into your circle. Now,
            they can change their beliefs without the risk of being abandoned
            socially.
          </p>

          <p>
            The British philosopher Alain de Botton suggests that we simply
            share meals with those who disagree with us:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Sitting down at a table with a group of strangers has the
              incomparable and odd benefit of making it a little more difficult
              to hate them with impunity. Prejudice and ethnic strife feed off
              abstraction. However, the proximity required by a meal – something
              about handing dishes around, unfurling napkins at the same moment,
              even asking a stranger to pass the salt – disrupts our ability to
              cling to the belief that the outsiders who wear unusual clothes
              and speak in distinctive accents deserve to be sent home or
              assaulted. For all the large-scale political solutions which have
              been proposed to salve ethnic conflict, there are few more
              effective ways to promote tolerance between suspicious neighbours
              than to force them to eat supper together.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Perhaps it is not difference, but distance that breeds tribalism and
            hostility. As proximity increases, so does understanding. I am
            reminded of Abraham Lincoln’s quote, “I don’t like that man. I must
            get to know him better.”
          </p>

          <p>Facts don’t change our minds. Friendship does.</p>

          <h2>The Spectrum of Beliefs</h2>
          <p>
            Years ago, Ben Casnocha mentioned an idea to me that I haven’t been
            able to shake: The people who are most likely to change our minds
            are the ones we agree with on 98 percent of topics.
          </p>

          <p>
            If someone you know, like, and trust believes a radical idea, you
            are more likely to give it merit, weight, or consideration. You
            already agree with them in most areas of life. Maybe you should
            change your mind on this one too. But if someone wildly different
            than you proposes the same radical idea, well, it’s easy to dismiss
            them as a crackpot.
          </p>

          <p>
            One way to visualize this distinction is by mapping beliefs on a
            spectrum. If you divide this spectrum into 10 units and you find
            yourself at Position 7, then there is little sense in trying to
            convince someone at Position 1. The gap is too wide. When you’re at
            Position 7, your time is better spent connecting with people who are
            at Positions 6 and 8, gradually pulling them in your direction.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most heated arguments often occur between people on opposite
            ends of the spectrum, but the most frequent learning occurs from
            people who are nearby. The closer you are to someone, the more
            likely it becomes that the one or two beliefs you don’t share will
            bleed over into your own mind and shape your thinking. The further
            away an idea is from your current position, the more likely you are
            to reject it outright.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to changing people’s minds, it is very difficult to
            jump from one side to another. You can’t jump down the spectrum. You
            have to slide down it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any idea that is sufficiently different from your current worldview
            will feel threatening. And the best place to ponder a threatening
            idea is in a non-threatening environment. As a result, books are
            often a better vehicle for transforming beliefs than conversations
            or debates.
          </p>

          <p>
            In conversation, people have to carefully consider their status and
            appearance. They want to save face and avoid looking stupid. When
            confronted with an uncomfortable set of facts, the tendency is often
            to double down on their current position rather than publicly admit
            to being wrong.
          </p>

          <p>
            Books resolve this tension. With a book, the conversation takes
            place inside someone’s head and without the risk of being judged by
            others. It’s easier to be open-minded when you aren’t feeling
            defensive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Arguments are like a full frontal attack on a person’s identity.
            Reading a book is like slipping the seed of an idea into a person’s
            brain and letting it grow on their own terms. There’s enough
            wrestling going on in someone’s head when they are overcoming a
            pre-existing belief. They don’t need to wrestle with you too.

          <h2>Why False Ideas Persist</h2>
          <p>
            There is another reason bad ideas continue to live on, which is that
            people continue to talk about them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Silence is death for any idea. An idea that is never spoken or
            written down dies with the person who conceived it. Ideas can only
            be remembered when they are repeated. They can only be believed when
            they are repeated.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have already pointed out that people repeat ideas to signal they
            are part of the same social group. But here’s a crucial point most
            people miss:
          </p>

          <p>
            People also repeat bad ideas when they complain about them. Before
            you can criticize an idea, you have to reference that idea. You end
            up repeating the ideas you’re hoping people will forget—but, of
            course, people can’t forget them because you keep talking about
            them. The more you repeat a bad idea, the more likely people are to
            believe it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let’s call this phenomenon Clear’s Law of Recurrence: The number of
            people who believe an idea is directly proportional to the number of
            times it has been repeated during the last year—even if the idea is
            false.
          </p>

          Here's the continuation of the text after "Each time you attack":
          ```html
          <p>
            Each time you attack a bad idea, you are feeding the very monster
            you are trying to destroy. As one Twitter employee wrote, “Every
            time you retweet or quote tweet someone you’re angry with, it helps
            them. It disseminates their BS. Hell for the ideas you deplore is
            silence. Have the discipline to give it to them.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Your time is better spent championing good ideas than tearing down
            bad ones. Don’t waste time explaining why bad ideas are bad. You are
            simply fanning the flame of ignorance and stupidity.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best thing that can happen to a bad idea is that it is
            forgotten. The best thing that can happen to a good idea is that it
            is shared. It makes me think of Tyler Cowen’s quote, “Spend as
            little time as possible talking about how other people are wrong.”
          </p>

          <p>Feed the good ideas and let bad ideas die of starvation.</p>

          <h2>The Intellectual Soldier</h2>
          <p>
            I know what you might be thinking. “James, are you serious right
            now? I’m just supposed to let these idiots get away with this?”
          </p>

          <p>
            Let me be clear. I’m not saying it’s never useful to point out an
            error or criticize a bad idea. But you have to ask yourself, “What
            is the goal?”
          </p>

          <p>
            Why do you want to criticize bad ideas in the first place?
            Presumably, you want to criticize bad ideas because you think the
            world would be better off if fewer people believed them. In other
            words, you think the world would improve if people changed their
            minds on a few important topics.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the goal is to actually change minds, then I don’t believe
            criticizing the other side is the best approach.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most people argue to win, not to learn. As Julia Galef so aptly puts
            it: people often act like soldiers rather than scouts. Soldiers are
            on the intellectual attack, looking to defeat the people who differ
            from them. Victory is the operative emotion. Scouts, meanwhile, are
            like intellectual explorers, slowly trying to map the terrain with
            others. Curiosity is the driving force.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want people to adopt your beliefs, you need to act more like
            a scout and less like a soldier. At the center of this approach is a
            question Tiago Forte poses beautifully, “Are you willing to not win
            in order to keep the conversation going?”
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Be Kind First, Be Right Later</h2>
          <p>
            The brilliant Japanese writer Haruki Murakami once wrote, “Always
            remember that to argue, and win, is to break down the reality of the
            person you are arguing against. It is painful to lose your reality,
            so be kind, even if you are right.”
          </p>

          <p>
            When we are in the moment, we can easily forget that the goal is to
            connect with the other side, collaborate with them, befriend them,
            and integrate them into our tribe. We are so caught up in winning
            that we forget about connecting. It’s easy to spend your energy
            labeling people rather than working with them.
          </p>

          <p>
            The word “kind” originated from the word “kin.” When you are kind to
            someone it means you are treating them like family. This, I think,
            is a good method for actually changing someone’s mind. Develop a
            friendship. Share a meal. Gift a book.
