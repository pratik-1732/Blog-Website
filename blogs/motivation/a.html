            In 1955, Disneyland had just opened in Anaheim, California, when a
            ten-year-old boy walked in and asked for a job. Labor laws were
            loose back then and the boy managed to land a position selling
            guidebooks for $0.50 apiece.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within a year, he had transitioned to Disney’s magic shop, where he
            learned tricks from the older employees. He experimented with jokes
            and tried out simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that
            what he loved was not performing magic but performing in general. He
            set his sights on becoming a comedian.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little
            clubs around Los Angeles. The crowds were small and his act was
            short. He was rarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most of
            the people in the crowd were too busy drinking or talking with
            friends to pay attention. One night, he literally delivered his
            stand-up routine to an empty club.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting
            better. His first routines would only last one or two minutes. By
            high school, his material had expanded to include a five-minute act
            and, a few years later, a ten-minute show. At nineteen, he was
            performing weekly for twenty minutes at a time. He had to read three
            poems during the show just to make the routine long enough, but his
            skills continued to progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            He spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing. He
            took a job as a television writer and, gradually, he was able to
            land his own appearances on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had
            worked his way into being a regular guest on The Tonight Show and
            Saturday Night Live.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, after nearly fifteen years of work, the young man rose to
            fame. He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days. Then seventy-two
            cities in eighty days. Then eighty-five cities in ninety days. He
            had 18,695 people attend one show in Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets
            were sold for his three-day show in New York. He catapulted to the
            top of his genre and became one of the most successful comedians of
            his time.

          <h2>How to Stay Motivated</h2>
          <p>
            I recently finished Steve Martin’s wonderful autobiography,
            <em>Born Standing Up</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Martin’s story offers a fascinating perspective on what it takes to
            stick with habits for the long run. Comedy is not for the timid. It
            is hard to imagine a situation that would strike fear into the
            hearts of more people than performing alone on stage and failing to
            get a single laugh. And yet Steve Martin faced this fear every week
            for eighteen years. In his words, “10 years spent learning, 4 years
            spent refining, and 4 years as a wild success.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their
            habits—whether practicing jokes or drawing cartoons or playing
            guitar—while most of us struggle to stay motivated? How do we design
            habits that pull us in rather than ones that fade away? Scientists
            have been studying this question for many years. While there is
            still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that the
            way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to
            work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.”
          </p>

          <h2>The Goldilocks Rule</h2>
          <p>
            The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an
            optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a
            serious match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become
            bored. It’s too easy. You’ll win every point. In contrast, if you
            play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena
            Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too
            difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As
            the game progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You
            have a good chance of winning, but only if you really try. Your
            focus narrows, distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully
            invested in the task at hand. This is a challenge of just manageable
            difficulty and it is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation
            when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current
            abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Martin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the Goldilocks
            Rule in practice. Each year, he expanded his comedy routine—but only
            by a minute or two. He was always adding new material, but he also
            kept a few jokes that were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just
            enough victories to keep him motivated and just enough mistakes to
            keep him working hard.

          <h2>Measure Your Progress</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to learn how to stay motivated to reach your goals, then
            there is a second piece of the motivation puzzle that is crucial to
            understand. It has to do with achieving that perfect blend of hard
            work and happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working on challenges of an optimal level of difficulty has been
            found to not only be motivating, but also to be a major source of
            happiness. As psychologist Gilbert Brim put it, “One of the
            important sources of human happiness is working on tasks at a
            suitable level of difficulty, neither too hard nor too easy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This blend of happiness and peak performance is sometimes referred
            to as flow, which is what athletes and performers experience when
            they are “in the zone.” Flow is the mental state you experience when
            you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world
            fades away.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to reach this state of peak performance, however, you not
            only need to work on challenges at the right degree of difficulty,
            but also measure your immediate progress. As psychologist Jonathan
            Haidt explains, one of the keys to reaching a flow state is that
            “you get immediate feedback about how you are doing at each step.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing yourself make progress in the moment is incredibly
            motivating. Steve Martin would tell a joke and immediately know if
            it worked based on the laughter of the crowd. Imagine how addicting
            it would be to create a roar of laughter. The rush of positive
            feedback Martin experienced from one great joke would probably be
            enough to overpower his fears and inspire him to work for weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other areas of life, measurement looks different but is just as
            critical for achieving a blend of motivation and happiness. In
            tennis, you get immediate feedback based on whether or not you win
            the point. Regardless of how it is measured, the human brain needs
            some way to visualize our progress if we are to maintain motivation.
            We need to be able to see our wins.

          <h2>Two Steps to Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            If we want to break down the mystery of how to stay motivated for
            the long-term, we could simply say:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Stick to The Goldilocks Rule and work on tasks of just manageable
              difficulty.
            </li>
            <li>
              Measure your progress and receive immediate feedback whenever
              possible.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Wanting to improve your life is easy. Sticking with it is a
            different story. If you want to stay motivated for good, then start
            with a challenge that is just manageable, measure your progress, and
            repeat the process.
