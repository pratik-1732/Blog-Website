            World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov on How to Build Confidence
          </h1>

          <p>
            Garry Kasparov and his long-time rival Anatoly Karpov—two of the
            greatest chess players of all-time—took their respective seats
            around the chess board. The 1990 World Chess Championship was about
            to begin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two men would play 24 games to decide the champion with the
            highest scoring player being declared the World Chess Champion. In
            total, the match would stretch for three months with the first 12
            games taking place in New York and the final 12 games being played
            in Lyon, France.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kasparov started off well, but soon began to make mistakes. He lost
            the seventh game and let multiple victories slip away during the
            first half of the tournament. After the first 12 games, the two men
            left New York with the match tied at 6-6. The New York Times
            reported that “Mr. Kasparov had lost confidence and grown nervous in
            New York.”
          </p>
          <p>
            If Kasparov was going to retain his title as the best in the world,
            it was going to take everything he had.

          <h2>“Playing Kasparov Chess”</h2>
          <p>
            Josh Waitzkin was a chess prodigy as a child and won multiple U.S.
            Junior Championships before the age of 10. Along the way, Waitzkin
            and his father had the opportunity to connect with Garry Kasparov
            and discuss chess strategy with him. In particular, they learned how
            Kasparov dealt with remarkably difficult matches like the one he
            faced against Karpov in the 1990 World Chess Championship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Waitzkin shares the story in his book,
            <em>The Art of Learning</em> (audiobook).
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Kasparov was a fiercely aggressive chess player who thrived on
              energy and confidence. My father wrote a book called
              <em>Mortal Games</em> about Garry, and during the years
              surrounding the 1990 Kasparov-Karpov match, we both spent quite a
              lot of time with him.
            </p>
            <p>
              At one point, after Kasparov had lost a big game and was feeling
              dark and fragile, my father asked Garry how he would handle his
              lack of confidence in the next game. Garry responded that he would
              try to play the chess moves that he would have played if he were
              feeling confident. He would pretend to feel confident, and
              hopefully trigger the state.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kasparov was an intimidator over the board. Everyone in the chess
              world was afraid of Garry and he fed on that reality. If Garry
              bristled at the chessboard, opponents would wither. So if Garry
              was feeling bad, but puffed up his chest, made aggressive moves,
              and appeared to be the manifestation of Confidence itself, then
              opponents would become unsettled. Step by step, Garry would feed
              off his own chess moves, off the created position, and off his
              opponent’s building fear, until soon enough the confidence would
              become real and Garry would be in flow…
            </p>
            <p>
              He was not being artificial. Garry was triggering his zone by
              playing Kasparov chess.
            </p>

          <p>
            When the second half of the World Chess Championship began in Lyon,
            France, Kasparov forced himself to play aggressive. He took the lead
            by winning the 16th game. With his confidence building, he rattled
            off decisive wins in the 18th and 20th games as well. When it was
            all said and done, Kasparov lost only two of the final 12 games and
            retained his title as World Chess Champion.
          </p>
          <p>He would continue to hold the title for another 10 years.</p>

          <h2>“Fake It Until You Become It”</h2>
          <p>
            It can be easy to view performance as a one-way street. We often
            hear about a physically gifted athlete who underperforms on the
            field or a smart student who flounders in the classroom. The typical
            narrative about underachievers is that if they could just “get their
            head right” and develop the correct “mental attitude” then they
            would perform at the top of their game.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no doubt that your mindset and your performance are
            connected in some way. But this connection works both ways. A
            confident and positive mindset can be both the cause of your actions
            and the result of them. The link between physical performance and
            mental attitude is a two-way street.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confidence is often the result of displaying your ability. This is
            why Garry Kasparov’s method of playing as if he felt confident could
            lead to actual confidence. Kasparov was letting his actions inspire
            his beliefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            These aren’t just feel-good notions or fluffy self-help ideas. There
            is hard science proving the link between behavior and confidence.
            Amy Cuddy, a Harvard researcher who studies body language, has shown
            through her groundbreaking research that simply standing in more
            confident poses can increase confidence and decrease anxiety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cuddy’s research subjects experienced actual biological changes in
            their hormone production including increased testosterone levels
            (which is linked to confidence) and decreased cortisol levels (which
            is linked to stress and anxiety). These findings go beyond the
            popular fake it until you make it philosophy. According to Cuddy,
            you can “fake it until you become it.”

          <h2>How to Build Confidence</h2>
          <p>
            When my friend Beck Tench began her weight loss journey, she
            repeatedly asked herself the question, “What would a healthy person
            do?”
          </p>
          <p>
            When she was deciding what to order a restaurant: what would a
            healthy person order? When she was sitting around on a Saturday
            morning: what would a healthy person do with that time? Beck didn’t
            feel like a healthy person at the start, but she figured that if she
            acted like a healthy person, then eventually she would become one.
            And within a few years, she had lost over 100 pounds.
