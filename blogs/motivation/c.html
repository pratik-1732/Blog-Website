            I am struggling today. If you’ve ever struggled to be consistent
            with something you care about, maybe my struggle will resonate with
            you too.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has been 939 days since November 12, 2012. That’s the date when I
            first published an article on JamesClear.com and it’s almost 2 years
            and 7 months ago. During these 939 mostly glorious, sometimes
            frustrating days, I have written a new post every Monday and
            Thursday. Week after week. Month after month. Year after year.
          </p>

          <h2>Today, I Feel Like Giving Up</h2>
          <p>
            But today? Well, today I am struggling. Today, I don’t feel like
            writing. Today, I don’t feel like sticking to the routine. Today, I
            don’t feel like I have any great ideas and I don’t feel like I have
            enough time to make the good ideas great. Today, I feel like giving
            up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research from the University of Pennsylvania has shown that grit is
            the characteristic linked most closely to success. I could use some
            grit today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s what I try to remind myself of when I feel like giving up…
          </p>

          <h2>Your Mind is a Suggestion Engine</h2>
          <p>
            Consider every thought you have as a suggestion, not an order. Right
            now, my mind is suggesting that I feel tired. It is suggesting that
            I give up. It is suggesting that I take an easier path.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I pause for a moment, however, I can discover new suggestions. My
            mind is also suggesting that I will feel very good about
            accomplishing this work once it is done. It is suggesting that I
            will respect the identity I am building when I stick to the
            schedule. It is suggesting that I have the ability to finish this
            task, even when I don’t feel like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, none of these suggestions are orders. They are merely
            options. I have the power to choose which option I follow.

          <h2>Discomfort Is Temporary</h2>
          <p>
            Relative to the time in your normal day or week, nearly any habit
            you perform is over quickly. Your workout will be finished in an
            hour or two. Your report will be typed to completion by tomorrow
            morning. This article will be finished in just a moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life is easier now than it has ever been. 300 years ago, if you
            didn’t kill your own food and build your own house, you would die.
            Today, we whine about forgetting our iPhone charger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maintain perspective. Your life is good and your discomfort is
            temporary. Step into this moment of discomfort and let it strengthen
            you.

          <h2>You Will Never Regret Good Work Once It is Done</h2>
          <p>
            Theodore Roosevelt famously said, “Far and away the best prize that
            life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.”
            So often it seems that we want to work easily at work worth doing.
            We want our work to be helpful and respected, but we do not want to
            struggle through our work. We want our stomachs to be flat and our
            arms to be strong, but we do not want to grind through another
            workout. We want the final result, but not the failed attempts that
            precede it. We want the gold, but not the grind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone can want a gold medal. Few people want to train like an
            Olympian.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, despite our resistance to it, I have never found myself
            feeling worse after the hard work was done. There have been days
            when it was damn hard to start, but it was always worth finishing.
            Sometimes, the simple act of showing up and having the courage to do
            the work, even in an average manner, is a victory worth celebrating.
          </p>

          <h2>This Is Life</h2>
          <p>
            Life is a constant balance between giving into the ease of
            distraction or overcoming the pain of discipline. It is not an
            exaggeration to say that our lives and our identities are defined in
            this delicate balance. What is life, if not the sum of a hundred
            thousand daily battles and tiny decisions to either gut it out or
            give it up?
          </p>
          <p>
            This moment when you don’t feel like doing the work? This is not a
            moment to be thrown away. This is not a dress rehearsal. This moment
            is your life as much as any other moment. Spend it in a way that
            will make you proud.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Let the World Decide</h2>
          <p>So, what do I do when I feel like giving up? I show up.</p>
          <p>
            Do I show up at my best? I doubt it. But my job isn’t to judge how
            good or how bad I am.
