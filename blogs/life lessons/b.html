      <h1>When the 80/20 Rule Fails: The Downside of Being Effective</h1>

      <p>Audrey Hepburn was an icon.</p>

      <p>
        Rising to fame in the 1950s, she was one of the greatest actresses of
        her era. In 1953, Hepburn became the first actress to win an Academy
        Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance:
        her leading role in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even today, over half a century later, she remains one of just 15 people
        to earn an “EGOT” by winning all four major entertainment awards: Emmy,
        Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. By the 1960s, she was averaging more than one
        new film per year and, by everyone’s estimation, she was on a trajectory
        to be a movie star for decades to come.
      </p>

      <p>But then something funny happened: she stopped acting.</p>

      <p>
        Despite being in her 30s and at the height of her popularity, Hepburn
        basically stopped appearing in films after 1967. She would perform in
        television shows or movies just five times during the rest of her life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, she switched careers. She spent the next 25 years working
        tirelessly for UNICEF, the arm of the United Nations that provides food
        and healthcare to children in war-torn countries. She performed
        volunteer work throughout Africa, South America, and Asia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hepburn’s first act was on stage. Her next act was one of service. In
        December 1992, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her
        efforts, which is the highest civilian award of the United States.
      </p>

      <p>We will return to her story in a moment.</p>

      <h2>Efficient vs. Effective</h2>

      <p>
        You get one, precious life. How do you decide the best way to spend your
        time? Productivity gurus will often suggest that you focus on being
        effective rather than being efficient.
      </p>

      <p>
        Efficiency is about getting more things done. Effectiveness is about
        getting the right things done. Peter Drucker, the well-known management
        consultant, once encapsulated the idea by writing, “There is nothing so
        useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.”
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, making progress is not just about being productive. It’s
        about being productive on the right things.
      </p>

      <p>
        But how do you decide what the “right things” are? One of the most
        trusted approaches is to use the Pareto Principle, which is more
        commonly known as the 80/20 Rule.
      </p>

      <h2>The Upside of the 80/20 Rule</h2>

      <p>
        When applied to your life and work, the 80/20 Rule can help you separate
        “the vital few from the trivial many.”
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, business owners may discover the majority of revenue comes
        from a handful of important clients. The 80/20 Rule would recommend that
        the most effective course of action would be to focus exclusively on
        serving these clients (and on finding others like them) and either stop
        serving others or let the majority of customers gradually fade away
        because they account for a small portion of the bottom line.
      </p>

      <p>
        This same strategy can be useful if you practice inversion and look at
        the sources of your problems. You may find that the majority of your
        complaints come from a handful of problem clients. The 80/20 Rule would
        suggest that you can clear out your backlog of customer service requests
        by firing these clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 80/20 Rule is like a form of judo for life and work. By finding
        precisely the right area to apply pressure, you can get more results
        with less effort. It’s a great strategy, and I have used it many times.
      </p>

      <p>
        But there is a downside to this approach, as well, and it is often
        overlooked. To understand this pitfall, we return to Audrey Hepburn.
      </p>

      <h2>The Downside of the 80/20 Rule</h2>

      <p>
        Imagine it is 1967. Audrey Hepburn is in the prime of her career and
        trying to decide how to spend her time.
      </p>

      <p>
        If she uses the 80/20 Rule as part of her decision-making process, she
        will discover a clear answer: do more romantic comedies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of Hepburn’s best films were romantic comedies like Roman Holiday,
        Sabrina, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and Charade. She starred in these four
        films between 1953 and 1963; by 1967, she was due for another one. They
        attracted large audiences, earned her awards, and were an obvious path
        to greater fame and fortune. Romantic comedies were effective for Audrey
        Hepburn.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, even if we take into account her desire to help children
        through UNICEF, an 80/20 analysis might have revealed that starring in
        more romantic comedies was still the best option because she could have
        maximized her earning power and donated the additional earnings to
        UNICEF.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, that’s all well and good if she wanted to continue acting.
        But she didn’t want to be an actress. She wanted to serve. And no
        reasonable analysis of the highest and best use of her time in 1967
        would have suggested that volunteering for UNICEF was the most effective
        use of her time.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the downside of the 80/20 Rule: A new path will never look like
        the most effective option in the beginning.
      </p>

      <h2>Optimizing for Your Past or Your Future</h2>

      <p>Here’s another example:</p>

      <p>
        Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, worked on Wall Street and climbed the
        corporate ladder to become senior vice-president of a hedge fund before
        leaving it all in 1994 to start the company.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Bezos had applied the 80/20 Rule in 1993 in an attempt to discover
        the most effective areas to focus on in his career, it is virtually
        impossible to imagine that founding an internet company would have been
        on the list. At that point in time, there is no doubt that the most
        effective path—whether measured by financial gain, social status, or
        otherwise—would have been the one where he continued his career in
        finance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 80/20 Rule is calculated and determined by your recent
        effectiveness. Whatever seems like the “highest value” use of your time
        in any given moment will be dependent on your previous skills and
        current opportunities.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 80/20 Rule will help you find the useful things in your past and get
        more of them in the future. But if you don’t want your future to be more
        of your past, then you need a different approach.
      </p>

      <h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>

      <p>
        Here’s the good news: given enough practice and enough time, the thing
        that previously seemed ineffective can become very effective. You get
        good at what you practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Audrey Hepburn dialed down her acting career in 1967, volunteering
        didn’t seem nearly as effective. But three decades later, she received
        the Presidential Medal of Freedom—a remarkable feat she is unlikely to
        have accomplished by acting in more romantic comedies.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process of learning a new skill or starting a new company or taking
        on a new adventure of any sort will often appear to be an ineffective
        use of time at first. Compared to the other things you already know how
        to do, the new thing will seem like a waste of time. It will never win
        the 80/20 analysis.
      </p>

      <p>But that doesn’t mean it’s the wrong decision.</p>
