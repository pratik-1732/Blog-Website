      <h1>Absolute Success is Luck. Relative Success is Hard Work.</h1>
      <p>
        In 1997, Warren Buffett, the famous investor and multi-billionaire,
        proposed a thought experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Imagine that it is 24 hours before you are going to be born,” he said,
        “and a genie comes to you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “The genie says you can determine the rules of the society you are about
        to enter and you can design anything you want. You get to design the
        social rules, the economic rules, the governmental rules. And those
        rules are going to prevail for your lifetime and your children’s
        lifetime and your grandchildren’s lifetime.”
      </p>
      <p>“But there is a catch,” he said.</p>
      <p>
        “You don’t know whether you’re going to be born rich or poor, male or
        female, infirm or able-bodied, in the United States or Afghanistan. All
        you know is that you get to take one ball out of a barrel with 5.8
        billion balls in it. And that’s you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “In other words,” Buffett continues, “you’re going to participate in
        what I call the Ovarian Lottery. And that is the most important thing
        that’s ever going to happen to you in your life. It’s going to determine
        way more than what school you go to, how hard you work, all kinds of
        things.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Buffett has long been a proponent for the role of luck in success. In
        his 2014 Annual Letter, he wrote, “Through dumb luck, [my business
        partner] Charlie and I were born in the United States, and we are
        forever grateful for the staggering advantages this accident of birth
        has given us.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When explained in this way, it seems hard to deny the importance of
        luck, randomness, and good fortune in life. And indeed, these factors
        play a critical role. But let’s consider a second story.
      </p>
      <h2>The Story of Project 523</h2>
      <p>
        In 1969, during the fourteenth year of the Vietnam War, a Chinese
        scientist named Tu Youyou was appointed the head of a secret research
        group in Beijing. The unit was known only by its code name: Project 523.
      </p>
      <p>
        China was an ally with Vietnam, and Project 523 had been created to
        develop antimalarial medications that could be administered to the
        soldiers. The disease had become a huge problem. Just as many Vietnamese
        soldiers were dying from malaria in the jungle as were dying in battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tu began her work by looking for clues anywhere she could find them. She
        read manuals about old folk remedies. She searched through ancient texts
        that were hundreds or thousands of years old. She traveled to remote
        regions in search of plants that might contain a cure.
      </p>
      <p>
        After months of work, her team had collected over 600 plants and created
        a list of almost 2,000 possible remedies. Slowly and methodically, Tu
        narrowed the list of potential medications down to 380 and tested them
        one-by-one on lab mice. “This was the most challenging stage of the
        project,” she said. “It was a very laborious and tedious job, in
        particular when you faced one failure after another.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Hundreds of tests were run. Most of them yielded nothing. But one
        test—an extract from the sweet wormwood plant known as qinghao—seemed
        promising. Tu was excited by the possibility, but despite her best
        efforts, the plant would only occasionally produce a powerful
        antimalarial medication. It wouldn’t always work. Her team had already
        been at work for two years, but she decided they needed to start again
        from the beginning. Tu reviewed every test and re-read each book,
        searching for a clue about something she missed. Then, magically, she
        stumbled on a single sentence in The Handbook of Prescriptions for
        Emergencies, an ancient Chinese text written over 1,500 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue was heat. If the temperature was too high during the
        extraction process, the active ingredient in the sweet wormwood plant
        would be destroyed. Tu redesigned the experiment using solvents with a
        lower boiling point and, finally, she had an antimalarial medication
        that worked 100 percent of the time.
      </p>
      <h2>The Power of Hard Work</h2>
      <p>
        With a proven medication in hand, it was now time for human trials.
        Unfortunately, there were no centers in China performing trials for new
        drugs at the time. And due to the secrecy of the project, going to a
        facility outside of the country was out of the question.
      </p>
      <p>They had reached a dead end.</p>
      <p>
        That’s when Tu volunteered to be the first human subject to try the
        medication. In one of the boldest moves in the history of medical
        science, she and two other members of Project 523 infected themselves
        with malaria and received the first doses of their new drug.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, despite her discovery of a breakthrough medication and her
        willingness to put her own life on the line, Tu was prevented from
        sharing her findings with the outside world. The Chinese government had
        strict rules that blocked the publishing of any scientific information.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not until 1978, almost a decade after she began and three years
        after the Vietnam War had ended, that Tu’s work was finally released to
        the outside world. She would have to wait until the year 2000 before the
        World Health Organization would recommend the treatment as a defense
        against malaria.
      </p>
      <h2>Luck or Hard Work?</h2>
      <p>
        Tu Youyou was not fabulously lucky. My favorite fact about her is that
        she has no postgraduate degree, no research experience abroad, and no
        membership in any of the Chinese national academies—a feat that has
        earned her the nickname “The Professor of the Three No’s”.
      </p>
      <p>
        But damn was she a hard worker. Persistent. Diligent. Driven. For
        decades she didn’t give up and she helped save millions of lives as a
        result. Her story is a brilliant example of how important hard work can
        be in achieving success.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what it is? What determines success? Hard work or good fortune?
        Effort or randomness? I think we all understand both factors play a
        role, but I’d like to give you a better answer than “It depends.”
      </p>
      <p>Here are two ways I look at the issue.</p>
      <h2>Absolute Success vs. Relative Success</h2>
      <p>
        One way to answer this question is to say: Luck matters more in an
        absolute sense and hard work matters more in a relative sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        The absolute view considers your level of success compared to everyone
        else. What makes someone the best in the world in a particular domain?
        When viewed at this level, success is nearly always attributable to
        luck. Even if you make a good initial choice—like Bill Gates choosing to
        start a computer company—you can’t understand all of the factors that
        cause world-class outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a general rule, the wilder the success, the more extreme and unlikely
        the circumstances that caused it. It’s often a combination of the right
        genes, the right connections, the right timing, and a thousand other
        influences that nobody is wise enough to predict.
      </p>
      <p>Absolute success is luck. Relative success is choices and habits.</p>
      <h2>The Slope of Success</h2>
      <p>
        There is another way to examine the balance between luck and hard work,
        which is to consider how success is influenced across time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine you can map success on a graph. Success is measured on the
        Y-axis. Time is measured on the X-axis. And when you are born, the ball
        you pluck out of Buffett’s Ovarian Lottery determines the y-intercept.
        Those who are born lucky start higher on the graph. Those who are born
        into tougher circumstances start lower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s the key: You can only control the slope of your success, not your
        initial position.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Atomic Habits, I wrote, “It doesn’t matter how successful or
        unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are
        putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned
        with your current trajectory than with your current results.”
      </p>
      <p>
        With a positive slope and enough time and effort, you may even be able
        to regain the ground that was lost due to bad luck. I thought this quote
        summarized it well: “The more time passes from the start of a race, the
        less the head-start others got matters.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, it is impossible to divorce the two. They both matter and
        hard work often plays a more important role as time goes on.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Get Luck on Your Side</h2>
      <p>
        By definition, luck is out of your control. Even so, it is useful to
        understand the role it plays and how it works so you can prepare for
        when fortune (or misfortune) comes your way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his fantastic talk, You and Your Research, the mathematician and
        computer engineer Richard Hamming summarized what it takes to do great
        work by saying, “There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there
        isn’t. The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and
        does it. So yes, it is luck. The particular thing you do is luck, but
        that you do something is not.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, we cannot control our luck—good or bad—but we can control
        our effort and preparation. Luck smiles on us all from time to time. And
        when it does, the way to honor your good fortune is to work hard and
        make the most of it.
