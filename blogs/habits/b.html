        The Ultimate Habit Tracker Guide: Why and How to Track Your Habits
      </h1>

      <h2>HABITS</h2>
      <p>
        This article includes an excerpt from Atomic Habits, my New York Times
        bestselling book.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to stick with a habit for good, one simple and effective
        thing you can do is keep a habit tracker.
      </p>

      <h2>Here’s why:</h2>

      <p>
        Elite performers will often measure, quantify, and track their progress
        in various ways. Each little measurement provides feedback. It offers a
        signal of whether they are making progress or need to change course.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gabrielle Hamilton, a chef in New York City, provides a good example.
        During an interview with the New York Times, she said, “The one thing I
        see that consistently separates the chef from the home cook is that we
        taste everything, all the time, before we commit it to the dish, right
        down to the grains of salt. We slurp shot glasses of olive oil and
        aerate them in our mouths as if it were a wine we were trying to know.
        We taste the lamb, the fish, the butter, the milk before we use it… we
        chew salt to see how we like it in our teeth, on our tongues, and to
        know its flavor, its salinity.”
      </p>

      <p>
        For the chef, tasting the ingredients tells them whether they are making
        progress toward their desired end goal. It provides the immediate
        feedback they need to get the recipe just right.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like a chef improving a recipe through trial and error, we often improve
        our habits through trial and error. If one approach doesn’t deliver the
        desired effect, then we adjust—like a chef tweaking the amount of an
        ingredient.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, there is an important difference between getting feedback while
        cooking a meal and getting feedback while building a habit. When it
        comes to building a habit, feedback is often delayed. It’s easy to taste
        an ingredient or to watch bread rise in the oven. But it can be
        difficult to visualize the progress you are making with your habits.
        Perhaps you’ve been running for a month, but you still don’t see a
        change in your body. Or maybe you managed to meditate for 16 straight
        days, but you still feel stressed and anxious at work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Habit formation is a long race. It often takes time for the desired
        results to appear. And while you are waiting for the long-term rewards
        of your efforts to accumulate, you need a reason to stick with it in the
        short-term. You need some immediate feedback that shows you are on the
        right path.
      </p>

      <p>And this is where a habit tracker can help.</p>

      <h2>The Habit Tracker: What It Is and How It Works</h2>

      <p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit.</p>

      <p>
        The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you
        stick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday,
        Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by,
        the calendar becomes a record of your habit streak.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make this process as easy as possible, I created the Habit Journal,
        which includes 12 habit tracker templates—one for each month. All you
        have to do is add your habit and start crossing off the days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Placing an X on each day is the classic look. I prefer something a
        little more design-oriented, so I shade in the cells on my habit
        tracker. You could also use checkmarks or fill your habit tracker with
        dots.
      </p>

      <p>
        No matter what design you choose, the key point is your habit tracker
        provides immediate evidence that you completed your habit. It’s a signal
        that you are making progress. Of course, that’s not all it does…
      </p>

      <p>Habit tracking is powerful for three reasons.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>It creates a visual cue that can remind you to act.</li>
        <li>
          It is motivating to see the progress you are making. You don’t want to
          break your streak.
        </li>
        <li>It feels satisfying to record your success in the moment.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Let’s break down each one.</h2>

      <h3>Benefit #1: A habit tracker reminds you to act.</h3>

      <p>
        Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues. When you look
        at the calendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals like
        losing weight, quitting smoking, and lowering blood pressure are all
        more likely to improve than those who don’t. One study of more than
        sixteen hundred people found that those who kept a daily food log lost
        twice as much weight as those who did not. A habit tracker is a simple
        way to log your behavior, and the mere act of tracking a behavior can
        spark the urge to change it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us think we act better
        than we do. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our
        own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day. When the
        evidence is right in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to
        yourself.
      </p>

      <h3>Benefit #2: A habit tracker motivates you to continue.</h3>

      <p>
        The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal
        that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down
        that path. In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on
        motivation. Each small win feeds your desire.
      </p>

      <p>
        This can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling
        down, it’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made.
        Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder
        of how far you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can
        motivate you to get started because you don’t want to lose your progress
        by breaking your streak.
      </p>

      <h3>Benefit #3: A habit tracker provides immediate satisfaction.</h3>

      <p>
        Finally, tracking feels rewarding. It is satisfying to cross an item off
        your to-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an
        X on the calendar. It feels good to watch your results grow and if it
        feels good, then you’re more likely to endure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on
        the process rather than the result. You’re not fixated on getting
        six-pack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the
        type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.
      </p>

      <h2>Habit Tracker Ideas</h2>

      <p>
        Alright, those benefits sound great, but it’s not necessary to fill your
        habit tracker with every habit that makes up your day. In fact, if
        you’re already sticking to a habit, then it seems like extra work to me
        to track it as well. So what should you measure in your habit tracker?
      </p>

      <p>
        Habit tracking can help kickstart a new habit or keep you on track with
        behaviors that you tend to forget or let slide when things get busy.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Atomic Habits, I recommend using the Two-Minute Rule, which suggests
        you scale your habits down until they take two minutes or less to
        perform. You can track whatever habits you want in your habit tracker,
        but I recommend starting with these super small habits to make sure that
        you are at least showing up in a small way each day. I’ll share some
        examples below and break them out by daily, weekly, and monthly habits.
      </p>

      <h3>Common daily habits to track:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>journal 1 sentence</li>
        <li>read 1 page</li>
        <li>meditate 1 minute</li>
        <li>do 1 push up</li>
        <li>stretch for 1 minute</li>
        <li>write 1 thing I’m grateful for</li>
        <li>make your bed</li>
        <li>wake up by [TIME]</li>
        <li>go to bed by [TIME]</li>
        <li>take a shower</li>
        <li>floss teeth</li>
        <li>weigh myself</li>
        <li>take medication</li>
        <li>take vitamins/supplements</li>
        <li>play [INSTRUMENT] for 1 minute</li>
        <li>contact 1 potential client</li>
        <li>prioritize to-do list</li>
        <li>say “I love you” at least once</li>
        <li>put all dishes put away</li>
        <li>take a walk outside</li>
        <li>call mom</li>
        <li>walk the dog</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Notice that most items on this list can be completed in two minutes or
        less. Make your habits so easy that you can stick to them even on the
        hard days.
      </p>

      <p>
        For something to become truly habitual, you need to repeat it
        frequently. As a result, most habits are daily. But it can also be
        helpful to use a habit tracker for various weekly or monthly routines.
        These behaviors won’t become “automatic” like tying your shoes or
        brushing your teeth, but a habit tracker can remind you to complete them
        nonetheless.
      </p>

      <h3>Common weekly habits to track:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>publish blog post</li>
        <li>vacuum</li>
        <li>take out trash/recycling</li>
        <li>do the laundry</li>
        <li>water the plants</li>
        <li>tidy up your bedroom</li>
        <li>write a thank you note</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Monthly habits:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>review finances</li>
        <li>transfer money to savings account</li>
        <li>pay off credit cards</li>
        <li>pay bills</li>
        <li>deep clean the house</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can also use a habit tracker to simply count how often you do
        something. For example, if you want to keep track of how many days you
        travel for work each month.
      </p>

      <h3>Other ideas:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>days spent traveling</li>
        <li>conduct weekly review</li>
        <li>conduct monthly review</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Finally, you can use a habit tracker to measure what you don’t do. I
        call these “habits of avoidance” (that is, behaviors you are trying to
        avoid).
      </p>

      <h3>Habits of avoidance:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>no alcohol</li>
        <li>no Netflix</li>
        <li>no online purchases</li>
        <li>no soda</li>
        <li>no sugar</li>
        <li>no caffeine</li>
        <li>no smoking</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Again, the Habit Journal offers a proven template and the fastest way to
        create your habit tracker. No need to spend an hour drawing your own
        grid. Just write your habits down and you’re ready to go.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Get in the Habit of Using Your Habit Tracker</h2>

      <p>
        Despite all of the benefits, a habit tracker is not something that makes
        sense in every situation or for every person. Many people resist the
        idea of tracking and measuring. It can feel like a burden because it
        forces you into two habits: the habit you’re trying to build and the
        habit of tracking it. That said, nearly anyone can benefit from habit
        tracking in one form or another—even if it’s only temporary.
      </p>

      <p>What can we do to make habit tracking easier?</p>

      <p>
        First, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits.
        It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track
        ten. I tend to keep my habit tracker simple and limit it to my three or
        four most important habits.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs. The
        completion of the habit is the cue to write it down. (This is a twist on
        the “habit stacking” approach I discuss in Chapter 5 of Atomic Habits.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Here’s the basic formula: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY
        HABIT].
      </p>

      <p>For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          After I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will mark the “call 1
          potential client” column.
        </li>
        <li>
          After I finish meditating, I will fill the “meditate for 1 minute”
          column.
        </li>
        <li>
          After I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will complete the “put all
          dishes away” column.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Basically, what we are talking about here is getting in the habit of
        using your habit tracker. These little rules help you remember to pick
        up your habit tracker and mark off another accomplishment.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Recover Quickly When Your Habits Break Down</h2>

      <p>Finally, I want to discuss what to do when you fall off the wagon.</p>

      <p>
        Every habit streak ends at some point. Perfection is not possible.
        Before long, an emergency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel
        for work or your family needs a little more of your time. Whenever this
        happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Never miss twice.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible.
        Missing one workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row.
        Maybe I’ll eat an entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy
        meal. As soon as one streak ends, I get started on the next one. I can’t
        be perfect, but I can avoid the second mistake.
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally speaking, the first mistake is never the one that ruins you.
        It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. As I write in Atomic
        Habits, “Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a
        new habit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The
        problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do
        something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure, a perfectly filled-in habit tracker looks beautiful and you should
        strive to achieve it whenever possible. But life is messy. In the long
        run, what matters is that you find a way to get back on track.
      </p>

      <h2>How Long Do I Need to Track My Habits?</h2>

      <p>
        One of the most common questions I get is “How long does it take to
        build a habit?”
      </p>

      <p>
        You’ll see all kinds of answers: 21 days, 30 days, 100 days. One popular
        answer right now is 66 days because there was one study that found that,
        on average, it took 66 days to build a habit. However, even within that
        study the range was quite wide depending on the difficulty of the habit.
      </p>

      <p>
        I find that people are really trying to get at something else when they
        ask, “How long does it take to build a habit?” What they often mean is,
        “How long until it’s easy? How long until I don’t have to put much
        effort in anymore?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Look, all habits get easier with practice. But this line of questioning
        ignores the real purpose of building better habits in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        How long does it take? The honest answer is: forever. Because once you
        stop doing it, it is no longer a habit.
      </p>

      <p>
        A habit is a lifestyle to be lived, not a finish line to be crossed. You
        are looking to make small, sustainable changes you can stick with for
        years. And a habit tracker is one tool in your toolbox on the road to
        behavior change. It is an effective way to visualize your progress and
        motivate you to show up again tomorrow.
