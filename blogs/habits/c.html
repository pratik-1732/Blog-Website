      <h1>The Surprising Benefits of Journaling One Sentence Every Day</h1>

      <p>
        From 1986 to 2011, Oprah Winfrey hosted The Oprah Winfrey Show. It was
        the highest rated talk show of all-time and familiar to nearly anyone
        who owned a television set in North America at that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the “Queen of All Media” built a brand
        that stretched far beyond the television screen. She went on to become a
        billionaire, a well-regarded philanthropist, and a recipient of the
        Presidential Medal of Freedom. And as she was busy working toward these
        otherworldly accomplishments, Oprah relied on a simple habit:
        journaling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Journaling is simply the act of thinking about your life and writing it
        down. That’s it. Nothing more is needed. But despite its simplicity, the
        daily journal has played a key role in the careers of many prolific
        people.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you might expect, journaling is a favorite habit of many writers.
        From Mark Twain to Virginia Woolf, Francis Bacon to Joan Didion, John
        Cheever to Vladimir Nabokov. A journal was rarely far from any of these
        artists. Susan Sontag once claimed that her journal was where she
        “created herself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Journaling has been utilized by scores of brilliant thinkers and
        inventors. Charles Darwin. Marie Curie. Leonardo da Vinci. Thomas
        Edison. Albert Einstein. Similarly, leaders and politicians throughout
        history have kept journals in one form or another. People like George
        Washington, Winston Churchill, and Marcus Aurelius. In the sporting
        world, athletes like Katie Ledecky, winner of multiple gold medals, and
        Eliud Kipchoge, the world record holder in the marathon, rely on
        journals to reflect on their daily workouts and improve their training.
      </p>

      <h2>What Journaling Can Do for You</h2>

      <p>
        Nearly anyone can benefit from getting their thoughts out of their head
        and onto paper. There are more benefits to journaling than I have time
        to cover here, but allow me to point out a few of my favorites.
      </p>

      <p>
        Journaling provides the opportunity to learn new lessons from old
        experiences. When looking back on her previous journal entries, Virginia
        Woolf remarked that she often “found the significance to lie where I
        never saw it at the time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Reading your old journal entries is a bit like reading a great book for
        a second time. You pick up on new sentences and see the past in a
        different way. Only this time, you are re-reading the story of your
        life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Journaling sharpens your memory. When Cheryl Strayed wrote her hit book,
        Wild, she relied heavily on her journal. She recalled, “My journal
        provided the who, what, how, when, and why with a specificity that
        memory might have blurred, but it also did something more: it offered me
        a frank and unvarnished portrait of myself at 26 that I couldn’t have
        found anywhere else.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Time will change your face without you noticing, but it will also change
        your thoughts without you realizing it. Our beliefs shift slowly as we
        gain experience and journal entries have the ability to freeze your
        thoughts in time. Seeing an old picture of yourself can be interesting
        because it reminds you of what you looked like, but reading an old
        journal entry can be even more surprising because it reminds you of how
        you thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        Journaling motivates you to make the most of each day. There is
        something about knowing that your day will be recorded that makes you
        want to make at least one good choice before the sun sets. I will
        sometimes find myself thinking, “I want to have something good to write
        down tonight.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Journaling provides proof of your progress. Writing down one sentence
        about what went well today gives you something powerful to look at when
        you’re feeling down. When you have a bad day, it can be easy to forget
        how much progress you have made. But with a journal, it’s easier to keep
        a sense of perspective. One glance at your previous entries and you have
        proof of how much you have grown over the months and years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, despite the numerous benefits of journaling, there is one
        problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many people like the idea of journaling, but few people stick with the
        act of journaling. It sounds great in theory, but making it a habit is
        another matter.
      </p>

      <p>This is where we return to Oprah’s story.</p>

      <h2>The Challenge of Making Journaling a Habit</h2>

      <p>
        In November 2012, after wrapping up her 25-year television career, Oprah
        wrote, “For years I’ve been advocating the power and pleasure of being
        grateful. I kept a gratitude journal for a full decade without fail—and
        urged you all to do the same. Then life got busy. My schedule
        overwhelmed me. I still opened my journal some nights, but my ritual of
        writing down five things I was grateful for every day started slipping
        away.”
      </p>

      <p>She picked up one of her old journals.</p>

      <p>
        “I wondered why I no longer felt the joy of simple moments,” Oprah said.
        “Since 1996 I had accumulated more wealth, more responsibility, more
        possessions; everything, it seemed, had grown exponentially—except my
        happiness. How had I, with all my options and opportunities, become one
        of those people who never have time to feel delight? I was stretched in
        so many directions, I wasn’t feeling much of anything. Too busy doing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        She admitted, “But the truth is, I was busy in 1996, too. I just made
        gratitude a daily priority. I went through the day looking for things to
        be grateful for, and something always showed up.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Most people know that journaling is helpful, but they never get around
        to making it a priority. How can we make journaling frictionless? What
        is the simplest way that to get the benefits of journaling without it
        feeling like another obligation?
      </p>

      <h2>How to Make Journaling Easy</h2>

      <p>
        I’ve spent a fair bit of time thinking about how to make journaling easy
        over the past year. In fact, I thought so much about it that I partnered
        with the premium notebook maker Baron Fig to create the Clear Habit
        Journal—a combination dot grid notebook, daily journal, and habit
        tracker that not only makes it easier to journal, but also easier to
        build any habit.
      </p>

      <p>But before I start hawking my wares, let’s get something straight.</p>

      <p>
        Here’s the truth: There’s no one “right” way to journal. You can do it
        wherever you want and in whatever way you want. All you need is a piece
        of paper or a blank document. However, although there is no right way to
        journal, there is an easy way to journal…
      </p>

      <p>Write one sentence per day.</p>

      <p>
        The primary advantage of journaling one sentence each day is that it
        makes journaling fun. It’s easy to do. It’s easy to feel successful. And
        if you feel good each time you finish journaling, then you’ll keep
        coming back to it.
      </p>

      <h2>Journaling Prompts That Make Journaling Easy</h2>

      <p>Let’s talk about the process I designed to make journaling a cinch.</p>

      <p>
        Every Habit Journal is designed to make the process of keeping a daily
        journal as easy as possible. It starts with a section called One Line
        Per Day.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the top of each One Line Per Day page is space for a journaling
        prompt. Here are a few examples of journaling prompts you could use:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>What happened today? (Daily journal)</li>
        <li>What am I grateful for today? (Gratitude journal)</li>
        <li>What is my most important task today? (Productivity journal)</li>
        <li>How did I sleep last night? (Sleep journal)</li>
        <li>How do I feel today? (Mood journal)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Underneath the prompt are 31 lines. One line for each day of the month.
        This is where you’ll write your one sentence each day.
      </p>

      <p>
        To start your journaling habit all you have to do is write your prompt
        for the month and jot down a few words each day. Once the month is
        complete, you can look back on 31 beautiful journal entries. The entire
        experience is designed to make journaling so easy that you can’t help
        but do it each day.
