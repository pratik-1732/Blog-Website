        Zanshin: Learning the Art of Attention and Focus From a Legendary
        Samurai Archer
      </h1>

      <h2>DELIBERATE PRACTICE FOCUS</h2>

      <p>
        In the 1920s, a German professor named Eugen Herrigel moved to Japan. He
        came to teach philosophy at a university a few hours northeast of Tokyo,
        in a city called Sendai.
      </p>

      <p>
        To deepen his understanding of Japanese culture, Herrigel began training
        in Kyudo, the Japanese martial art of archery. He was taught by a
        legendary archer named Awa Kenzo. Kenzo was convinced that beginners
        should master the fundamentals of archery before attempting to shoot at
        a real target, and he took this method to the extreme. For the first
        four years of his training, Herrigel was only allowed to shoot at a roll
        of straw just seven feet away.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Herrigel complained of the incredibly slow pace, his teacher
        replied “The way to the goal is not to be measured! Of what importance
        are weeks, months, years?”
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was finally permitted to shoot at more distant targets,
        Herrigel’s performance was dismal. The arrows flew off course and he
        became more discouraged with each wayward shot. During a particularly
        humbling session, Herrigel stated that his problem must be poor aim.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kenzo, however, looked at his student and replied that it was not
        whether one aimed, but how one approached the task that determined the
        outcome. Frustrated with this reply, Herrigel blurted out, “Then you
        ought to be able to hit it blindfolded.”
      </p>

      <h2>Archery in the Dark</h2>
      <p>
        After night had fallen, the two men returned to the courtyard where the
        practice hall was located. Kenzo walked to his usual shooting location,
        now with the target hidden in the dark. The archery master proceeded
        through his normal routine, settled into his firing stance, drew the bow
        string tight, and released the first arrow into the darkness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recalling the event later, Herrigel wrote, “I knew from the sound that
        it had hit the target.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Immediately, Kenzo drew a second arrow and again fired into the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Herrigel jumped up and ran across the courtyard to inspect the target.
        In his book, Zen in the Art of Archery, he wrote, “When I switched on
        the light over the target stand, I discovered to my amazement that the
        first arrow was lodged full in the middle of the black, while the second
        arrow had splintered the butt of the first and ploughed through the
        shaft before embedding itself beside it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Kenzo had hit a double bullseye without being able to see the target.
      </p>

      <h2>Everything Is Aiming</h2>
      <p>
        Great archery masters often teach that “everything is aiming.” Where you
        place your feet, how you hold the bow, the way you breathe during the
        release of the arrow—it all determines the end result.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the case of Awa Kenzo, the master archer was so mindful of the
        process that led to an accurate shot that he was able to replicate the
        exact series of internal movements even without seeing the external
        target. This complete awareness of the body and mind in relation to the
        goal is known as zanshin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zanshin is a word used commonly throughout Japanese martial arts to
        refer to a state of relaxed alertness. Literally translated, zanshin
        means “the mind with no remainder.” In other words, the mind completely
        focused on action and fixated on the task at hand. Zanshin is being
        constantly aware of your body, mind, and surroundings without stressing
        yourself. It is an effortless vigilance.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, though, zanshin has an even deeper meaning. Zanshin is
        choosing to live your life intentionally and acting with purpose rather
        than mindlessly falling victim to whatever comes your way.
      </p>

      <h2>The Enemy of Improvement</h2>
      <p>
        There is a famous Japanese proverb that says, “After winning the battle,
        tighten your helmet.”
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, the battle does not end when you win. The battle only
        ends when you get lazy, when you lose your sense of commitment, and when
        you stop paying attention. This is zanshin as well: the act of living
        with alertness regardless of whether the goal has already been achieved.
      </p>

      <p>We can carry this philosophy into many areas of life.</p>

      <p>
        Writing: The battle does not end when you publish a book. It ends when
        you consider yourself a finished product, when you lose the vigilance
        needed to continue improving your craft.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fitness: The battle does not end when you hit a PR. It ends when you
        lose concentration and skip workouts or when you lose perspective and
        overtrain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Entrepreneurship: The battle does not end when you make a big sale. It
        ends when you get cocky and complacent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The enemy of improvement is neither failure nor success. The enemy of
        improvement is boredom, fatigue, and lack of concentration. The enemy of
        improvement is a lack of commitment to the process because the process
        is everything.
      </p>

      <h2>The Art of Zanshin in Everyday Life</h2>
      <p>
        “One should approach all activities and situations with the same
        sincerity, the same intensity, and the same awareness that one has with
        bow and arrow in hand.”
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: right">—Kenneth Kushner, One Arrow, One Life</p>

      <p>
        We live in a world obsessed with results. Like Herrigel, we have a
        tendency to put so much emphasis on whether or not the arrow hits the
        target. If, however, we put that intensity and focus and sincerity into
        the process—where we place our feet, how we hold the bow, how we breathe
        during the release of the arrow—then hitting the bullseye is simply a
        side effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        The point is not to worry about hitting the target. The point is to fall
        in love with the boredom of doing the work and embrace each piece of the
        process. The point is to take that moment of zanshin, that moment of
        complete awareness and focus, and carry it with you everywhere in life.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not the target that matters. It is not the finish line that
        matters. It is the way we approach the goal that matters. Everything is
        aiming. Zanshin.
