            <h1>How Experts Figure What to Focus On</h1>

            <p>
              Peak performance experts say things like, “You should focus. You
              need to eliminate the distractions. Commit to one thing and become
              great at that thing.”
            </p>

            <p>
              This is good advice. The more I study successful people from all
              walks of life—artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, scientists—the
              more I believe focus is a core factor of success.
            </p>

            <p>But there is a problem with this advice too.</p>

            <p>
              Of the many options in front of you, how do you know what to focus
              on? How do you know where to direct your energy and attention? How
              do you determine the one thing that you should commit to doing?
            </p>

            <p>
              I don’t claim to have all the answers, but let me share what I’ve
              learned so far.
            </p>

            <h2>“Until Something Comes Easily…”</h2>

            <p>
              Like most entrepreneurs, I struggled through my first year of
              building a business.
            </p>

            <p>
              I launched my first product without having any idea who I would
              sell it to. (Big surprise, nobody bought it.) I reached out to
              important people, mismanaged expectations, made stupid mistakes,
              and essentially ruined the chance to build good relationships with
              people I respected. I attempted to teach myself how to code, made
              one change to my website, and deleted everything I had done during
              the previous three months.
            </p>

            <p>To put it simply, I didn’t know what I was doing.</p>

            <p>
              During my Year of Many Errors I received a good piece of advice:
              “Try things until something comes easily.” I took the advice to
              heart and tried four or five different business ideas over the
              next 18 months. I’d give each one a shot for two or three months,
              mix in a little bit of freelance work so I could continue scraping
              by and paying the bills, and repeat the process.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually, I found “something that came easily” and I was able to
              focus on building one business rather than trying to find an idea.
              In other words, I was able to simplify.
            </p>

            <p>
              This was the first thing I discovered about figuring out what to
              focus on. If you want to master and deeply understand the core
              fundamentals of a task you may, paradoxically, need to start by
              casting a very wide net. By trying many different things, you can
              get a sense of what comes more easily to you and set yourself up
              for success. It is much easier to focus on something that’s
              working than struggle along with a bad idea.
            </p>

            <h2>Make a Call About What to Focus On</h2>

            <p>
              Assuming you’re willing to try things and experiment a bit, the
              next question is, “How do I know what’s coming easily to me?”
            </p>

            <p>
              The best answer I can give is to pay attention. Usually, this
              means measuring something.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                If you’re an entrepreneur, track your marketing and promotion
                efforts.
              </li>
              <li>If you’re trying to gain muscle, track your workouts.</li>
              <li>
                If you’re learning an instrument, track your practice sessions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Even when you do measure things, however, there comes a point
              where you have to make a call and decide what to focus on.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my mind, this moment of decision is one of the central tensions
              of entrepreneurship. Do we continue trying new things or do we
              double down on one strategy? Do we try to innovate or do we commit
              to doing one thing well?
            </p>

            <p>
              Everyone wants to know the right time to simplify and focus on one
              thing, but nobody does. That’s what makes success so hard.
              Entrepreneurship isn’t like baking a cake. There is no recipe.
              There is no guidebook.
            </p>

            <p>
              At this stage, your best option is to decide. You can’t try
              everything. At some point, you don’t need more information, you
              just need to make a choice.
            </p>

            <h2>A Volume of Work</h2>

            <p>
              Now we have reached the stage where figuring out what to focus on
              becomes a real possibility.
            </p>

            <p>
              You have experimented with enough ideas to discover one or two
              options that seem to provide better than average results for you.
              You’ve overcome the hurdle of wanting more information and the
              fear of committing to something and now you’ve made a choice. You
              took the job. You started the business. You signed up for the
              class. You’re ready.
            </p>

            <p>
              Welcome to the grind. It’s time to put in a volume of work. Not
              just once or twice. Not just when it’s easy. But a consistent,
              repeated volume of work. You have to fall in love with boredom and
              stay on the bus.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is through this sheer number of repetitions that you’ll come to
              understand the fundamentals of your task. You might know what
              greatness looks like before this point, but you won’t understand
              how to achieve greatness until you’ve put the work in yourself.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the words of Ira Glass, “your taste is good enough that you can
              tell that what you’re making is kind of a disappointment to you.”
              You’ll bridge that gap between what you know is good and what you
              can produce yourself by putting in the reps.
            </p>

            <p>This applies to so many areas of life.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Want to dress well and develop killer style? You’re going to
                have to try on a lot of clothes before you can simplify down to
                the essentials. You’ll probably have to buy a lot of clothes
                before you can really get a feel for what your day-in, day-out
                style is. I’m not a fan of promoting rampant consumerism, but if
                that’s the skill set you want to develop then it’s likely going
                to take some experimentation and effort.
              </li>
              <li>
                Want to become a great cook? How many bad meals do you think you
                need to make before you can whip up a “simple, but tasty dinner”
                whenever you feel like it? I’d say hundreds at least. I don’t
                know many people who are amazing cooks after making their tenth
                meal ever. Developing a deep understanding of the fundamentals
                of cooking takes a while.
              </li>
              <li>
                Want to write an amazing book? You’re going to have to write and
                write and write some more. You need to write hundreds of
                thousands of words to find your voice, maybe millions. Then you
                need to edit those words and whittle them down to the most
                powerful version possible.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Only after the repetitions have been completed will you understand
              which pieces of the task are fundamental to success.
            </p>

            <h2>Getting to Simple</h2>

            <p>
              Now, finally, after trying many things and figuring out what to
              focus on and putting in enough reps, you can begin to simplify.
              You can trim away the fat because you know what is essential and
              what is unnecessary.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the Frenchman Blaise Pascal famously wrote in his Provincial
              Letters, “If I had more time, I would have written you a shorter
              letter.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Mastering the fundamentals is often the hardest and longest
              journey of all.
