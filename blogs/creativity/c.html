      <h1>Creativity Is a Process, Not an Event</h1>

      <p>
        In 1666, one of the most influential scientists in history was strolling
        through a garden when he was struck with a flash of creative brilliance
        that would change the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        While standing under the shade of an apple tree, Sir Isaac Newton saw an
        apple fall to the ground. “Why should that apple always descend
        perpendicularly to the ground,” Newton wondered. “Why should it not go
        sideways, or upwards, but constantly to the earth’s center? Assuredly,
        the reason is, that the earth draws it. There must be a drawing power in
        matter.”
      </p>

      <p>And thus, the concept of gravity was born.</p>

      <p>
        The story of the falling apple has become one of the lasting and iconic
        examples of the creative moment. It is a symbol of the inspired genius
        that fills your brain during those “eureka moments” when creative
        conditions are just right.
      </p>

      <p>
        What most people forget, however, is that Newton worked on his ideas
        about gravity for nearly twenty years until, in 1687, he published his
        groundbreaking book,
        <i>The Principia: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</i>. The
        falling apple was merely the beginning of a train of thought that
        continued for decades.

      <p>
        Newton isn’t the only one to wrestle with a great idea for years.
        Creative thinking is a process for all of us. In this article, I’ll
        share the science of creative thinking, discuss which conditions drive
        creativity and which ones hinder it, and offer practical tips for
        becoming more creative.
      </p>

      <h2>Creative Thinking: Destiny or Development?</h2>

      <p>
        Creative thinking requires our brains to make connections between
        seemingly unrelated ideas. Is this a skill that we are born with or one
        that we develop through practice? Let’s look at the research to uncover
        an answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the 1960s, a creative performance researcher named George Land
        conducted a study of 1,600 five-year-olds and 98 percent of the children
        scored in the “highly creative” range. Dr. Land re-tested each subject
        during five year increments. When the same children were 10-years-old,
        only 30 percent scored in the highly creative range. This number dropped
        to 12 percent by age 15 and just 2 percent by age 25. As the children
        grew into adults they effectively had the creativity trained out of
        them. In the words of Dr. Land, “non-creative behavior is learned.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar trends have been discovered by other researchers. For example,
        one study of 272,599 students found that although IQ scores have risen
        since 1990, creative thinking scores have decreased.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not to say that creativity is 100 percent learned. Genetics do
        play a role. According to psychology professor Barbara Kerr,
        “approximately 22 percent of the variance [in creativity] is due to the
        influence of genes.” This discovery was made by studying the differences
        in creative thinking between sets of twins.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of this to say, claiming that “I’m just not the creative type” is a
        pretty weak excuse for avoiding creative thinking. Certainly, some
        people are primed to be more creative than others. However, nearly every
        person is born with some level of creative skill and the majority of our
        creative thinking abilities are trainable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that we know creativity is a skill that can be improved, let’s talk
        about why—and how—practice and learning impacts your creative output.
      </p>

      <h2>Intelligence and Creative Thinking</h2>

      <p>What does it take to unleash your creative potential?</p>

      <p>
        As I mentioned in my article on Threshold Theory, being in the top 1
        percent of intelligence has no correlation with being fantastically
        creative. Instead, you simply have to be smart (not a genius) and then
        work hard, practice deliberately and put in your reps.
      </p>

      <p>
        As long as you meet a threshold of intelligence, then brilliant creative
        work is well within your reach. In the words of researchers from a 2013
        study, “we obtained evidence that once the intelligence threshold is
        met, personality factors become more predictive for creativity.”
      </p>

      <h3>Threshold Theory (Creative Thinking)</h3>

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

      <p>
        What exactly are these “personality factors” that researchers are
        referring to when it comes to boosting your creative thinking?
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the most critical components is how you view your talents
        internally. More specifically, your creative skills are largely
        determined by whether you approach the creative process with a fixed
        mindset or a growth mindset.
      </p>

      <p>
        The differences between these two mindsets are described in detail in
        Carol Dweck’s fantastic book,
        <i>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</i> (audiobook).
      </p>

      <p>
        The basic idea is that when we use a fixed mindset we approach tasks as
        if our talents and abilities are fixed and unchanging. In a growth
        mindset, however, we believe that our abilities can be improved with
        effort and practice. Interestingly, we can easily nudge ourselves in one
        direction or another based on how we talk about and praise our efforts.
      </p>

      <p>Here’s a brief summary in Dweck’s words:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “The whole self-esteem movement taught us erroneously that praising
          intelligence, talent, abilities would foster self-confidence,
          self-esteem, and everything great would follow. But we’ve found it
          backfires. People who are praised for talent now worry about doing the
          next thing, about taking on the hard task, and not looking talented,
          tarnishing that reputation for brilliance. So instead, they’ll stick
          to their comfort zone and get really defensive when they hit setbacks.
        </p>

        <p>
          So what should we praise? The effort, the strategies, the doggedness
          and persistence, the grit people show, the resilience that they show
          in the face of obstacles, that bouncing back when things go wrong and
          knowing what to try next. So I think a huge part of promoting a growth
          mindset in the workplace is to convey those values of process, to give
          feedback, to reward people engaging in the process, and not just a
          successful outcome.”
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: right">—Carol Dweck</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Embarrassment and Creativity</h2>

      <p>
        How can we apply the growth mindset to creativity in practical terms? In
        my experience, it comes down to one thing: the willingness to look bad
        when pursuing an activity.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Dweck says, the growth mindset is focused more on the process than
        the outcome. This is easy to accept in theory, but very hard to stick to
        in practice. Most people don’t want to deal with the accompanying
        embarrassment or shame that is often required to learn a new skill.
      </p>

      <p>
        The list of mistakes that you can never recover from is very short. I
        think most of us realize this on some level. We know that our lives will
        not be destroyed if that book we write doesn’t sell or if we get turned
        down by a potential date or if we forget someone’s name when we
        introduce them. It’s not necessarily what comes after the event that
        worries us. It’s the possibility of looking stupid, feeling humiliated,
        or dealing with embarrassment along the way that prevents us from
        getting started at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to fully embrace the growth mindset and enhance your
        creativity, you need to be willing to take action in the face of these
        feelings which so often deter us.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Be More Creative</h2>

      <p>
        Assuming that you are willing to do the hard work of facing your inner
        fears and working through failure, here are a few practical strategies
        for becoming more creative.
      </p>

      <h3>Constrain yourself.</h3>
      <p>
        Carefully designed constraints are one of your best tools for sparking
        creative thinking. Dr. Seuss wrote his most famous book when he limited
        himself to 50 words. Soccer players develop more elaborate skill sets
        when they play on a smaller field. Designers can use a 3-inch by 5-inch
        canvas to create better large scale designs. The more we limit
        ourselves, the more resourceful we become.
      </p>

      <h3>Write more.</h3>
      <p>
        For nearly three years, I published a new article every Monday and every
        Thursday at JamesClear.com. The longer I stuck with this schedule, the
        more I realized that I had to write about a dozen average ideas before I
        uncovered a brilliant one. By producing a volume of work, I created a
        larger surface area for a creative spark to hit me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not interested in sharing your writing publicly? Julia Cameron’s Morning
        Pages routine is a fantastic way to use writing to increase your
        creativity even if you have no intention of writing for others.
      </p>

      <h3>Broaden your knowledge.</h3>
      <p>
        One of my most successful creative strategies is to force myself to
        write about seemingly disparate topics and ideas. For example, I have to
        be creative when I use 1980s basketball strategies or ancient word
        processing software or zen buddhism to describe our daily behaviors. In
        the words of psychologist Robert Epstein, “You’ll do better in
        psychology and life if you broaden your knowledge.”
      </p>

      <h3>Sleep longer.</h3>
      <p>
        In my article on how to get better sleep, I shared a study from the
        University of Pennsylvania, which revealed the incredible impact of
        sleep on mental performance. The main finding was this: Sleep debt is
        cumulative and if you get 6 hours of sleep per night for two weeks
        straight, your mental and physical performance declines to the same
        level as if you had stayed awake for 48 hours straight. Like all
        cognitive functions, creative thinking is significantly impaired by
        sleep deprivation.
      </p>

      <h3>Enjoy sunshine and nature.</h3>
      <p>
        One study tested 56 backpackers with a variety of creative thinking
        questions before and after a 4-day backpacking trip. The researchers
        found that by the end of the trip the backpackers had increased their
        creativity by 50 percent. This research supports the findings of other
        studies, which show that spending time in nature and increasing your
        exposure to sunlight can lead to higher levels of creativity.
      </p>

      <h3>Embrace positive thinking.</h3>
      <p>
        It sounds a bit fluffy for my taste, but positive thinking can lead to
        significant improvements in creative thinking. Why? Positive psychology
        research has revealed that we tend to think more broadly when we are
        happy. This concept, which is known as the Broaden and Build Theory,
        makes it easier for us to make creative connections between ideas.
        Conversely, sadness and depression seems to lead to more restrictive and
        limited thinking.
      </p>

      <h3>Ship it.</h3>
      <p>
        The honest truth is that creativity is just hard work. The single best
        thing you can do is choose a pace you can sustain and ship content on a
        consistent basis. Commit to the process and create on a schedule. The
        only way creativity becomes a reality is by shipping.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts on Creative Thinking</h2>

      <p>
        Creativity is a process, not an event. It’s not just a eureka moment.
        You have to work through mental barriers and internal blocks. You have
        to commit to practicing your craft deliberately. And you have to stick
        with the process for years, perhaps even decades like Newton did, in
        order to see your creative genius blossom.
