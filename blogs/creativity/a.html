            Nearly all great ideas follow a similar creative process and this
            article explains how this process works. Understanding this is
            important because creative thinking is one of the most useful skills
            you can possess. Nearly every problem you face in work and in life
            can benefit from innovative solutions, lateral thinking, and
            creative ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone can learn to be creative by using these five steps. That’s
            not to say being creative is easy. Uncovering your creative genius
            requires courage and tons of practice. However, this five-step
            approach should help demystify the creative process and illuminate
            the path to more innovative thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            To explain how this process works, let me tell you a short story.
          </p>

          <h3>A Problem in Need of a Creative Solution</h3>
          <p>
            In the 1870s, newspapers and printers faced a very specific and very
            costly problem. Photography was a new and exciting medium at the
            time. Readers wanted to see more pictures, but nobody could figure
            out how to print images quickly and cheaply.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if a newspaper wanted to print an image in the 1870s,
            they had to commission an engraver to etch a copy of the photograph
            onto a steel plate by hand. These plates were used to press the
            image onto the page, but they often broke after just a few uses.
            This process of photoengraving, you can imagine, was remarkably time
            consuming and expensive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The man who invented a solution to this problem was named Frederic
            Eugene Ives. He went on to become a trailblazer in the field of
            photography and held over 70 patents by the end of his career. His
            story of creativity and innovation, which I will share now, is a
            useful case study for understanding the 5 key steps of the creative
            process.
          </p>

          <h3>A Flash of Insight</h3>
          <p>
            Ives got his start as a printer’s apprentice in Ithaca, New York.
            After two years of learning the ins and outs of the printing
            process, he began managing the photographic laboratory at nearby
            Cornell University. He spent the rest of the decade experimenting
            with new photography techniques and learning about cameras,
            printers, and optics.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1881, Ives had a flash of insight regarding a better printing
            technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            “While operating my photostereotype process in Ithaca, I studied the
            problem of halftone process,” Ives said. “I went to bed one night in
            a state of brain fog over the problem, and the instant I woke in the
            morning saw before me, apparently projected on the ceiling, the
            completely worked out process and equipment in operation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Ives quickly translated his vision into reality and patented his
            printing approach in 1881. He spent the remainder of the decade
            improving upon it. By 1885, he had developed a simplified process
            that delivered even better results. The Ives Process, as it came to
            be known, reduced the cost of printing images by 15x and remained
            the standard printing technique for the next 80 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alright, now let’s discuss what lessons we can learn from Ives about
            the creative process.
          </p>

          <h3>The 5 Stages of the Creative Process</h3>
          <p>
            In 1940, an advertising executive named James Webb Young published a
            short guide titled, A Technique for Producing Ideas. In this guide,
            he made a simple, but profound statement about generating creative
            ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Young, innovative ideas happen when you develop new
            combinations of old elements. In other words, creative thinking is
            not about generating something new from a blank slate, but rather
            about taking what is already present and combining those bits and
            pieces in a way that has not been done previously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most important, the ability to generate new combinations hinges upon
            your ability to see the relationships between concepts. If you can
            form a new link between two old ideas, you have done something
            creative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Young believed this process of creative connection always occurred
            in five steps.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Gather new material.</span>At first, you learn. During this
              stage you focus on 1. learning specific material directly related
              to your task and 2. learning general material by becoming
              fascinated with a wide range of concepts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Thoroughly work over the materials in your mind.</span
              >During this stage, you examine what you have learned by looking
              at the facts from different angles and experimenting with fitting
              various ideas together.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Step away from the problem.</span> Next, you put the problem
              completely out of your mind and go do something else that excites
              you and energizes you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Let your idea return to you.</span>At some point, but only
              after you have stopped thinking about it, your idea will come back
              to you with a flash of insight and renewed energy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Shape and develop your idea based on feedback.</span>For any
              idea to succeed, you must release it out into the world, submit it
              to criticism, and adapt it as needed.
            </li>
          </ul>
